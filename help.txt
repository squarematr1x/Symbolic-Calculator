Simplifying algebraic expressions:

	For simplifying expressions just type the expression by using the CLI:

	>> x^2yx

	The output of the simplification process should be next shown below:

	   simplified: x^3y

	Multiplication and spaces are optional, but they can be used if desired

	>> x^2 * y * x
	   simplified: x^3y

Functions:
	
	In this section 'expr' means any algebraic expression (it can also be just a numeric value)

	Trigonometric functions:
	
	- sin(expr)	sine of expr
	- cos(expr)	cosine of expr
	- tan(expr)	tangent of expr
	
	Example:
	
	>> sin(0)+cos(0)
	   simplified: 1

	Logarithms:
	
	- ln(expr)	natural logarithm
	- log(expr)	logarithm with base 10
	- log10(expr)	logartihm with base 10
	- log2(expr)	logarithm with base 2
	
	Example:
	
	>> ln(xe)
	   simplified: ln(x)+1
	
	Derivative:

	- D(expr)	derivative of expr with respect to x
	
	Example:

	>> D(x^2+x^3)
	   simplified: 2x+3x^2

Special characters and strings:

	Character 'e' is used for Euler's number (approx. 2.71828)
	String "pi" (in lower case) is used for pi (approx. 3.14159)
	Character '!' is used for factorial

Other commands:

	For clearing the console type:

	>> clear

	To quit the software type:

	>> exit
